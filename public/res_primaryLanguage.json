      "description": "I'm Luke Rogers. I live in Wheaton, Illinois where I graduated from Wheaton College with a bachelors in Business Economics. I was also a two-sport athlete, playing offensive line for the football team and throwing shot-put and discus on the track team. After graduating, I worked as a project manager at a small web development company. During my time there, I observed the developers and the work they did and I decided I wanted to become one. I enrolled in a full time software development bootcamp where I learned languages such as JavaScript, CSS, and React, amongst others. After my bootcamp, I taught myself Python. I am now a UX Projects manager at Christianity Today and web development freelancer for authors excited to use my creativity and problem-solving skills to build tools that will help those in need.",

When they hit submit, a Yelp API sends data to an array matching the criteria they requested. Then I use a random number generator to grab a random restaurant in the array to show to the user. The user can then hit \"make reservation\" which prompts them to fill out a form in order to make a reservation to the restaurant. The information entered will be uploaded to MongoDB and displayed on the reservations page. The user can also update and delete the reservation.",
