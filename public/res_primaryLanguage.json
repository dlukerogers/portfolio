      "description": "I'm Luke Rogers. I live in Wheaton, Illinois where I graduated from Wheaton College with a bachelors in Business Economics. I was also a two-sport athlete, playing offensive line for the football team and throwing shot-put and discus on the track team. After graduating, I worked as a project manager at a small web development company. During my time there, I observed the developers and the work they did and I decided I wanted to become one. I enrolled in a full time software development bootcamp where I learned languages such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and React, amongst others. I am now a professional software developer excited to use my creativity and problem-solving skills to build tools that will help those in need.",
